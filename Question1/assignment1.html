Assume the semantics are correct;  ie: if it's marked up as a heading, it's a heading.  If it's marked up as a list, it's a list.  Don't fix the semantics.  Just change from ARIA to HTML.</p>

				<p>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I've opened a door here that I regret.</p>
				<p>Marry me. <strong> No, I did not kill Kitty.</strong> <em> However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</em> What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?</p>

				<p>No… but I'd like to be asked! Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I'm a monster. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.</p>

				<p>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. I've opened a door here that I regret. Across from where?</p>
